## Concept

Given multiple nodes - objects of information - in 3D space, we need ways of creating, editing and displaying their logical but intangible connections



### [Connect Edit R1]( https://rawgit.com/opentecture/mindmapping/master/connect-edit/r1/connect-edit.html )

* Creates
	* Two objects
	* Two control points
	* Three types of connecting spline
	* An object that may be moved but has no connections
* Mouseover displays name and position of currently selected object
* All objects may be moved in 3D space
