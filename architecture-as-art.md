# Architecture as Art

It can as show itself as it was - either by what it displays on its wall publicly or what it provides as a view in your augmented reality.

* Like any work of art, you can view the architects statement and view the sketches.
* View its references and other similar buildings
* colors and shapes will change

## Architecture as 3D printed by a reusable goop'

You will go to a national park and choose an empty site. The next day your house or whatever house you want has been built - and will be there for the duration of your stay. Soon after you leave the site will return to the near primeval state it was in before your arrival.

Your house will be a Sol Lewitt. An instruction of what to build.

The street can look like 1856 or 1956 - it can look like whatever the residents want it to look like

Everybody get x thousands of kilos of goop they can do whatever they want with. Build a monk's retreat. Join together and build a skyscraper or they can go on the road.

You can only have one house at a time. Or two because you nee a second while the first is being built or torn down.

Some people will never move and others will move all the time.

The lots will be bigger the streets will be smaller.

It will be the end of architecture as we know it. Any building can be anything. any building can morph into anything else.So what is it? What is its essence?

It's a bit like thinking of heaven. If you were to go to heaven which person would you want to be? A 16-year-old, your 36-year-old self or the mature person?
certainly there will be very skillful designers. People who know how to morph buildings better than others. But the transition will be as drastic as it was between designers with good paper and designers who are good in CAD/CAM systems.

All buildings will be tested before they are built. Users will be able to travel through the building and try everything out before it's actually built.

The architect, the engineers and the client will all visit the building many times before the first shovel full of earth is moved.

Currently most architects produce sheets of paper which are the instructions as to how to build the building. They are just a set of semantics. Yes, most clients can look at a floor plan and make a pretty good guess of what the instructions are saying. The building of the future will be something that you will look through your 3-D goggles and you will be able to see almost a perfect representation of the building as it will be built.

What will the aesthetics of the future be like? What will be the golden rules of architecture?

Will it all be merely state sets and representations of game assets? Or will new theories of architecture emerge? Of course it's the latter, the series that will emerge are likely to be strange and almost unrecognizable to us.

All of this is architecture that is:
* Firm commodious and delightful
* Architecture is frozen music (Goethe)
* Form follows function (Sullivan?)
* Less is More (Breuer)
* The house is a machine for living (Le Corbusier)
* Less is a bore (Venturi)

Architecture as:
* displays of quantitative information
* Timeless energy aware artifacts.
* Built by robots who assemble components created by 3D printers
* Updated frequently because the printers use a reusable 3D goop.

The building will breathe and undulate - filtering air, generate electricity, store power, clean water, nurture useful bacteria, store data, provide entertainment

It will be easier to live anywhere because the building will take care of the utilities
