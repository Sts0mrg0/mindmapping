# [MindMapping Read Me]( https://opentecture.github.io/mindmapping/#README.md )

A work-in-progress. An investigation.


## [GraphQL 3D Read Me ]( https://opentecture.github.io/mindmapping/#graphql-3d/README.md )

* Visualize and query various remote static data sets on the web in 3D
* 'Tween' the data into various before and after positions
* View associated text data and be able to click on any available links in that data
* Add, edit and save overrides and/or additional data alongside the given data
* Any remote data is refreshed at with a page reload



## [Connect Edit Read Me]( https://opentecture.github.io/mindmapping/#connect-edit/README.md )

Given multiple nodes - objects of information - in 3D space, we need ways of creating, editing and displaying their logical but intangible connections



## [Mindmap 3D Read Me ]( https://opentecture.github.io/mindmapping/#mindmap-3d/README.md )

An introduction to Wardley (Value Chain) Mapping
* https://blog.gardeviance.org/2015/02/an-introduction-to-wardley-value-chain.html

MindMads that are geared up to display Wardley Maps
* Editable by a casual user
* Nodes that look and feel like real things
	* Easy to import and add SVG files
* A multitude of ways of showing the many links and connections between nodes
* Nodes have links to user editable Markdown files
* Nodes can be moved anywhere in 3D space and grouped in a variety of ways
* Nodes can be of different types: people, apps, formats


## [CSS32D]( https://opentecture.github.io/mindmapping/css2d/index.html )

* A fork from [Three.js examples]( https://threejs.org/examples/ )
* The mixture of 3D models along with 2D HTML text in a single scene spurred the idea for a 3D [mindmap]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map )
