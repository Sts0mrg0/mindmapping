* Several of you have knowledge you would like to share


### Standing on the shoulders of Giants

* Much of your knowledge is available instantly via links
	* Via links to web pages or to ISBN references or online documents
* Your links are selected, prioritized and commented
* The collection of links together may be considered to form an authoritative view of the topic in question
* The content at the link destinations generally follow [Wikipedia Core Content Policies]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Core_content_policies )
	* Neutral Point of View
	* Verifiability
	* No original research


### Sharing

* The knowledge in each link must be made availble with a click or twp
* No paywalls
* Much of the knowledge is available in small chunks
	* Just-in-time learning
	* Examples include most Wikipedia articles and Khan Academy's three minute videos


### Simplicity

* Easy code
* Easy data format


### Freedom of display

* Standard two panel trees

	* Its concepts
	* Features and benefits
	* Current issues

### Longer term vision
