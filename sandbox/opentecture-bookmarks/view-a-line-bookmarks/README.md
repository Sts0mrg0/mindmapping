## Full Screen: [Opentecture Bookmarks View-a-line]( https://opentecture.github.io/mindmapping/sandbox/opentecture-bookmarks/view-a-line-bookmarks/index.html )


## Concept

This script is a side project of the [gbXML to JSON Lines]( https://www.ladybug.tools/spider/#sandbox/gbxml-to-json-lines/README.md) project.

It is a work-in-progress continuation of exploring, manipulating and hacking the [JSON Lines file format]( http://jsonlines.org/ ) in unusual, useful and fun ways.


### Objectives
* Access very large numbers of bookmarks
* View contents of many sites in a speedy fashion
* Categorize and tag bookmarks with ease and speed
* Speed up identification with descriptions added on-the-fly
* Curate the output using comments

### Features include:

* Read JSON Lines files created by [Opentecture Bookmarks Add-a-line]( https://opentecture.github.io/mindmapping/#sandbox/opentecture-bookmarks/add-a-line-bookmarks/README.md )
* Display tree menu of bookmarks with HTML details elements
* For every bookmark allow
	* Display web page in an iframe
	* Open web page in new tab
	* Edit bookmark json
* Save edits to new file (Not in R4 but coming back soon )


## To Do / Wish List

* 2019-02-12 ~ Turn titles of things like university names to links to suitable page
* 2019-02-11 ~ Add line type of comments, link to type "url" and display appropriately
* 2019-02-11 ~ Add ability to do screen capture of pages and save / save to Imgur? for reuse instead of iframes


## Notes

* Best to have the JavaScript console open so you can view the errors. There are many issues still to be dealt with in displaying web sites in iframes
	* Also iframes issues with HTTP/HTTPS are different depending on whether you are running locally or on a sever
* After editing a JSON bookmark, you must save to a file and then reload the page. Future release will be more convenient.
* Be sure to create and keep back up files of the data files
* Tags currently being used as catagories. This will change
* Does not yet handle file not found errors well
* Comments, adding new bookmarks will happen in future releases
