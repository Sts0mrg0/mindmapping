## Concept

There are many excellent lists on the web, For example:

* https://frontendmasters.com/books/front-end-handbook/2018/tools/css.html
* https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome
* https://github.com/asciimoo/ListOfGithubLists

You can spend many enjoyable hours exploring the links in these lists.  There are several issues with this.

* Given hundreds of links, how can you prioritize what you want to see?
* Having seen a number of good pages, how can you come back to the list and return to the pages you like and not return to the pages you did not feel are useful to you?
* Given hundreds of links, how can you use search tools to help you find sites of current interest?

### Mission

An annotated visual bibliographies of webpages may be of use in helping you research a project, come up to speed in a field you are unfamiliar with and help give you reminders of what you have seen already/


## Full Screen: [Annotated Bibliography R1]( https://opentecture.github.io/#mindmapping/sandbox/annotated-bibliography/annotated-bibliography-r1.html )

* Given a JavaScript array of URLs
* Fetches the content of the home page
* Parses text using [DOMParser]( https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMParser )
* Extracts and displays the title and description
* Displays the favicon - very work in progress
* Displays thumbnails of images from the home page


## Issues

* Add ability to export data to a Markdown file so it can become part of a series of static pages
	* The idea being that the static page might be regenerated and updated several times a year
* The title 'annotated bibliography' may cause people to think this project is about gathering citations to printed books. It is not.
* The favicon feature should not display and empty image if the favicon is not found
* Currently on only a single sort of favicon is searched for. There are several common ways of linking to favicons. The script should add more of the ways of capturing them
* Currently only images with absolute URLs are displayed, An ability to display images with relative URLs should be added
* Currently no body text is searched for or displayed. This could be added
* Add ability to add data from a Gist or other external file to particular entries
