### [4x4xcm-square.html]( #sandbox/openstructures/4x4xcm-square.html )

* Based on OpenStructures diagram

## Concept

A free open source software toolkit for designing openstructures parts and assemblies


## To Do / Wish List

* 2018-08-04 ~ Theo ~ assemblies with parts cut to length and not to 60 cm sections
* 2018-08-04 ~ Theo ~ rule-driven methods to add flat surfaces to assembles
* 2018-08-04 ~ Theo ~ colors, lights, shadows

> OpenStructures is an open source modular construction model based on a shared geometrical grid, called the OS grid. It was conceived by designer Thomas Lommée, and first demonstrated at the Z33, a house for contemporary art. According to Lommee, the OpenStructures project explores the possibility of a modular system where "everyone designs for everyone." OpenStructures is developing a database where anyone can share designs which are in turn available for download by the public. Each component design in the OS system will feature previously designed OS parts that were used to create it. In addition, each part will feature component designs that can be made from it.


### [Soma cube]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soma_cube )

> The Soma cube is a solid dissection puzzle invented by Piet Hein in 1936[1] during a lecture on quantum mechanics conducted by Werner Heisenberg. Seven pieces made out of unit cubes must be assembled into a 3×3×3 cube. The pieces can also be used to make a variety of other 3D shapes.
>
> The pieces of the Soma cube consist of all possible combinations of three or four unit cubes, joined at their faces, such that at least one inside corner is formed. There is one combination of three cubes that satisfies this condition, and six combinations of four cubes that satisfy this condition, of which two are mirror images of each other (see Chirality). Thus, 3 + (6 × 4) is 27, which is exactly the number of cells in a 3×3×3 cube.
